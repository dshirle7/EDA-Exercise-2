    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "Think of the initial experiment as sorting the data in to 'black-sounding' and 'white-sounding'. For both groups, we can compute the callback mean (i.e. the proportion of candidates which received a callback), then we can see what the difference between the two groups' means is. We observed a difference of 3%. To test whether that difference could have happened by chance, we scrambled the callback data into two meaningless groups of the same size as our original groups, and compute the difference of those random groups' means—it should be close to zero. We did that ten thousand times. That allowed us to see how often we get a 3% difference across two random groups, compared to when the data were divided into two meaningful groups (i.e. 'black' and 'white'). We found that we <i>practically never</i> see a 3% difference or higher due to chance, so we can conclude with confidence that we observed an outcome difference between black-sounding names and white-sounding names. White-sounding names get about 50% more callbacks (9.6% of the time instead of 6.4% of the time).\n",

    "Not at all! My analysis merely prdemonstrates that race/name is <b>one</b> of the factors in callback success. I cannot make any claims about the other variables, because I did not test them. In order to determine which factor is most important, I would need to perform more tests on each of the other variables presented. I would want to see which factor correlates most strongly with success, not just which one is the most statistically significant. Multivariable statistics would show which factors are most correlated with success, or we could create a machine learning model which determines the most important factors by trial and error.\n",
